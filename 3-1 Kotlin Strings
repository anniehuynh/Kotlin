Create a program that intialize two String variables: firstName and lastName. The value of the firstName is Kate and lastName is Hudson.

The program prints the intials of the name variables.


Example output:
Your initials: K.H
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "

//Solution

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    var firstName: String = "Kate";
    var firstNameChar = firstName[0];
    var lastName: String = "Hudson";
    var lastNameChar = lastName[0];
    println("Your initials: " + "$firstNameChar" + "." + "$lastNameChar")}
