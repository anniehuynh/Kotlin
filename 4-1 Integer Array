Create an array of integers with the following values [0, 3, 6, 9]. Use the Array class constructor. Print the first and the last elements of the array.


Example output:
The first: 0
The last: 9
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "

//solution
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	var numbers = Array(4) {i -> i * 3}
	println("The first: " + numbers[0])
	println("The last: " + numbers[3])
}
