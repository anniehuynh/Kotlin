Create an array with the following values: 11, 16, 7, 8, 14, 5, 9, 3. The program calculates the average of the numbers in the array. Note! The average is floating point number.

 


Example output:
Average = 9.125
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "

//solution

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	val numbers = arrayOf(11, 16, 7, 8, 14, 5, 9, 3)
	val average = numbers.average()
	print("Average = ${average.toFloat()}")
}
