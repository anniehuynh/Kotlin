Create Kotlin program that asks month number and prints the correct month name using the when. Use Java Scanner class for the user input.


Example output:
Type a month number (1-12)
3
March
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "

//Solution

import java.util.Scanner
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	val input = Scanner(System.`in`)
	println("Type a month number (1-12)")
	val month = input.nextInt()
	val res = when(month) {
		1 -> "January"
		2 -> "February"
		3 -> "March"
		4 -> "April"
		5 -> "May"
		6 -> "June"
		7 -> "July"
		8 -> "August"
		9 -> "September"
		10 -> "October"
		11 -> "November"
		else -> "December"
	}
	println("$res")
}
