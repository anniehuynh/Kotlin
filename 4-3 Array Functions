Create an array that contains the following names: Mary, Paul, Jane, Phil, John, Jane, Paul, Anthony, Mary. The program prints the amount of distinct names. It also prints the first and the last names in the alphabetical order.


Example output:
There is 6 distinct names
The first in the alphabetical order is Anthony
The last in the alphabetical order is Phil
The verification of program output is not case-sensitive
//solution

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    var names = arrayOf<String>("Mary", "Paul", "Jane", "Phil", "John", "Jane", "Paul", "Anthony", "Mary")
    names.sort()
    println("There is " + names.distinct().count() + " distinct names")
    println("The first in the alphabetical order is " + names.first())
    println("The last in the alphabetical order is " + names.last())


}
