The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "

//solution
fun main(args : Array<String>) {
	val names = mutableListOf("Jim", "Mary", "Matt", "Priscilla", "Mike", "Kelly")
	fun count() {
		val filteredNames = names.filter{it. startsWith("M")}
		println(filteredNames.size)
	}
	count()
}
