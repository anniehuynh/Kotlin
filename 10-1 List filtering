Create a list that contains the following strings: "Kotlin", "Programming", "String", "List", "Algorithm" and name it words. Create a new array using the filter() function to the words array. New array contain words where the length is less than 7 characters. Print the content of the new array by using toString() function.


Example output:
[Kotlin, String, List]
The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)Hide
 //solution
 fun main(args : Array<String>) {

    val words = mutableListOf("Kotlin", "Programming", "String", "List",  "Algorithm")
    fun filter() {
        val filteredNames = words.filter { it.length < 7 }
        println(filteredNames.toString())
    }
    filter()
}
