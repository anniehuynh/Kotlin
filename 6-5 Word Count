Create a program that ask user to type words. The program execution stops when a user types letter 'x'. Finally, program prints the number of words.


Example output:
Type a word (Type x to exit)
Hello
Type a word (Type x to exit)
Kotlin
Type a word (Type x to exit)
Viope
Type a word (Type x to exit)
x
You typed 3 words
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "

//solution
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    var count = 0
    while (true) {
        println("Type a word (Type x to exit)")
        var input = readLine()
        if (input == "x") {
            break;
        }
        count++
    }
    println("You typed $count words")
}
