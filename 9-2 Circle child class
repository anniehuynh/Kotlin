Create a class called Circle that inherits Shape class. The circle class has one double type property called radius and a member function called getArea().  The getArea() function returns area of a circle. The area is calulated using the following formula: radius * radius * 3.14159.

Create a new Circle object in the main function. Set the radius value to 5.5. Then call the getArea() function and print out the result.

 


Example output:
The area = 95.0330975
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "
//solution

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    var shp = Shape()
    var crl = Circle()
    crl.print()
}

class Shape() {
    private var xPos: Int = 0
    private var yPos: Int = 0

}

class Circle() {
    private var radius: Double = 5.5
    fun getArea(): Double {
        return radius * radius * 3.14159
    }
    fun print() {
        println("The area = ${getArea()}")
    }

}
