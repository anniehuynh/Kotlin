Write Kotlin program that read a String from the keyboard and convert it to Double.


Example output:
Type a string:
3
Double value: 3.0
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "

//Solution
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	println("Type a string: \n")
	val input = readLine()!!
	println("Double value: " + input.toDouble())
}
