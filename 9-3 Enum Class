Create the enum class called Priority. The class has the following constants: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH. Print the values and ordinals in the main function.


Example output:
0 : LOW
1 : MEDIUM
2 : HIGH
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "

//solution

fun main(args : Array<String>) {
  for (Priority in Priority.values()) {
    println("${Priority.ordinal} : ${Priority.name}")
  }
}

enum class Priority {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
  
}
