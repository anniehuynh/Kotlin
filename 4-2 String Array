Create an array of strings with the following values ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"]. Print out the second element of the array.


Example output:
Two
The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)

//Solution
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	var strings = arrayOf<String>("One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five")
	println(strings[1])
	
}
